:: Viewfinder Head Tracking - Install
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - install body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/install-body-bepinex.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: install behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper.
::
:: Source of truth for everything below the CONFIG BLOCK:
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/install-wrapper-bepinex.cmd. Copy this
:: file to <mod>/scripts/install.cmd, fill in the CONFIG BLOCK, change nothing
:: else. scripts/conformance.ps1 checks that nothing else changed.
::
:: Two BepInEx variants, dispatched by BEPINEX_SUBFOLDER: leave it empty for
:: a regular BepInEx_win_<arch>.zip extracted to the game root, or set it to
:: the wrapper directory name for a Thunderstore BepInExPack_<Game>, whose
:: contents are flattened out of that directory into the game root.

:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
