/// degrees, the picture just moves further, by the ratio between the two fields
/// of view. Uncorrected, the player reads that as the mod's sensitivity changing
/// under them.
///
/// The correction is one number: scale the pose so its SCREEN displacement is
/// what it would have been at the game's un-zoomed field of view. It is exactly
/// 1.0 when nothing has narrowed the view, so ordinary play is untouched.
///
/// Yaw, pitch and the lean all TRANSLATE the image across the frame, so all
/// three scale. Roll ROTATES it about the view axis, and ten degrees of head
/// roll rolls the picture ten degrees at every field of view there is, so roll
/// is left alone.
