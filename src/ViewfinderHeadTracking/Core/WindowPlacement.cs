/// next launch, so a window dragged off to one side comes back off to one side;
/// the decision taken at startup is what brings it back to the middle.

/// The window is found by class name. BepInEx's console belongs to the same
/// process, is visible, is unowned and is larger than any size floor, so a search
/// that only filters on the process can return the console and centre that
/// instead while the log line claims the game moved. The render window is the one
/// whose class is <c>UnityWndClass</c>.

/// The work area, not the monitor bounds: centring against the full monitor puts
/// the title bar behind a top-docked taskbar, and the window cannot then be
